Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Network. I worked on building a model that accurately predicts handwritten digits using the Keras library.<br>
Dataset Used:<br> Consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each 28x28 pixels.<br>

Steps Performed:<br>
-Analyzed dataset shape and features.<br>
-Split the data into training and testing sets.<br>
-Scaled and flattened the images.<br>
-Built neural networks with and without hidden layers using various different parameters.<br>
-Achieved 99% accuracy on the training set and 97% on the test set.<br>

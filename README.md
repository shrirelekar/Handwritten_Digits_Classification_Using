Handwritten Digits Classification Using Neural Network. I worked on building a model that accurately predicts handwritten digits using the Keras library.
Dataset Used: Consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each 28x28 pixels.

Steps Performed:
-Analyzed dataset shape and features.
-Split the data into training and testing sets.
-Scaled and flattened the images.
-Built neural networks with and without hidden layers using various different parameters.
-Achieved 99% accuracy on the training set and 97% on the test set.
